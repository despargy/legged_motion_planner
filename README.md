# legged_motion_planner

Trajectory optimization
for motion planner based on centroidal dynamic

solving with IPOPT.
in ROS env.

k-leg parametric robots.

Reasonable solution given that we do not consider phases.

Future work, phase of ith leg motion, swing phases and all support phases.

Under results, there is a more detailed report.
